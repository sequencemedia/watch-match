# @sequencemedia/watch-match

Watch a file system directory path and replace a _string pattern_ in its files whenever a file is added or modified

From the command line

```shell
npm start -- \
  --path '~/Documents/m3u' \
  --from '/Users/sequencemedia/Music/m4a' \
  --to '/Volumes/Audio/Assets' \
  --type 'm3u'
```

Or with the default export

```javascript
import watchMatch from '@sequencemedia/watch-match'

const path = '~/Documents/m3u'
const from = '/Users/sequencemedia/Music/m4a'
const to = '/Volumes/Audio/Assets'
const type = 'm3u'

watchMatch(path, from, to, type)
```

For example, You have an application generating `m3u` files. Each file is written to a directory

That directory is the `path`

```shell
cd ~/Documents/m3u
ls -l
-rw-r--r--    1 sequencemedia  staff    1879 04 Feb 08:08 The Doors - The Doors.m3u
-rw-r--r--    1 sequencemedia  staff    1879 04 Feb 08:09 The Doors - Strange Days.m3u
-rw-r--r--    1 sequencemedia  staff    1879 04 Feb 08:10 The Doors - Waiting For The Sun.m3u
```

Each file contains a _pattern_ you want to replace. In this case, the _pattern_ is also a _file system path_ `/Users/sequencemedia/Music/m4a` (but it could be _any_ string)

That is the `from`
